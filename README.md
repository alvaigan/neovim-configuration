# Overview
This is my Neovim configuration. I built this configuration for more easier and simple.

# Requirement
- Neovim v0.11.6
- Git

# Installation
Clone the configuration to your local. The configuration should be placed in this location **~/.config/nvim**. If the location isn't exist, you need to create by yourself.
``` bash
$ mkdir ~/.config/nvim
$ git clone ....git
$ nvim
```
After following the steps, now you can use the neovim properly.
